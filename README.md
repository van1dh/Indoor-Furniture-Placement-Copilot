# Indoor-Furniture-Placement-Copilot
## Introduction

Nowadays, as homes become more intelligent and personalized, optimizing space for both aesthetics and functionality is becoming an essential part of modern living. With the assistance of machine learning and co-pilot technologies, it’s possible to get suggestions for ideal furniture layouts based on real-life data such as activity patterns. The indoor furniture placement copilot project utilizes AI and machine learning to create a tool that can give furniture placement plans based on safety and comfort.

## User Stories
### User Story 1: Child-Safe Room Design for Parents
	A mother wants to make her living room safe for her toddler, ensuring that sharp or fragile furniture is kept out of the child’s reach. She seeks help from the furniture placement copilot to suggest an arrangement that leaves ample space for her child to play without tripping hazards.
### User Story 2: Accessible Bedroom for Mobility-Impaired Adults
	A wheelchair user needs a bedroom layout that provides easy access to the bed, closet, and desk, with enough space to maneuver the wheelchair. The copilot assists in rearranging furniture to optimize accessibility while maintaining functionality.
### User Story 3: Shared Space Optimization for Tenants
	A group of four students, two boys, and two girls, live in one studio, with boys needing space to play together, girls gossiping together, and everyone get privacies. They also need some space for group work. They want the furniture arranged in a way that accommodates everyone’s needs without making the space feel cramped or chaotic.
